Markdown is a method of writing information, and using syntax to format that information. This is information can be converted directly into HTML.
--- 
## Syntax
+ using "#" will create headers. Increasing the number of "#'s" will reduce the size of the header.
+ typing ** ** or __ __ will create **bold** text.
+ typing _ _ or * * will create _italicised_ text.
+ through typing "-", "+" or "*" a bullet list can be created.
+ two spaces at the end of a line will create a one line break.
+ typing "---" will create a horizontal line, useful for separating information.
+ typing "1. 2. 3. etc " will create a numbered list.
+ typing "[link]""(the actual link)" (*without the "'s*).

## **Command-line 101**

The following bullets are commands that can be entered into a terminal to achieve a certain result and an overview of what those results are.
+ "$ ls" will list the directory contents.
+ "$ cd /tmp" will move to a temporary directory (using the RAM) this will be deleted after this session, however using the RAM will mean it is a lot faster.
+ the command "cd" will change directory.
bENCHMRK3242! trying to reach when using the "cd" command. e.g. "cd $HOME" is the same as cd "/students/home".
+ "mkdir" will make a directory.
+ "echo "*thing*"" will write thing. " echo "Hello" > hello.md" will make a document and write "hello" in that document.
+ "cat hello.md" will write out the contents of the document "hello".
+ cp hello.md hello-again.md will create a "hello-again doc" and copy the contents of "hello" into "hello-again".
+ "mv hello-again.md hello-hello.md" will rename "hello-again" to "hello-hello".
+ "rm hello.md" will remove the doc "hello".
+ "> hi.md" will create a doc called "hi".
+ "rm -rf" will remove files without question or inhibition repeatedly.
+ "cat /proc/cpuinfo" will display the info of the cpu.
+ typing "ls -al" will give you a detailed of all files in the directory

The first picture [Single Core Motor]()


### Single Core 
+ AIM:

- To know the key parts of a DC motor
- make a single coil dc motor


+ Parts for the motor:
[Parts of the Motor]()
- a cork
- copper tape
- a nail
- 4 neodymium magnets
- wooden base
- 4 paper clips
- copper coil


+ procedure:
- insert the nail through both ends of the cork
- Commutator - stick 2 peices of copper tape on one end of the cork (make sure they don't touch)
- Armature - wind the wire around the cork and make sure both the ends are free
- Bend the paperclips to hold the magnets
- solder the ends of the coil to each piece of copper tape
- apply power to the commutator using wires by using the ends of the wires like brushes

#DC MOTOR with 4 coils:

+ Aim:
- to make a 4 coil DC motor

+ procedure:
- 3d design the armature and print it.
- 3d print the magnetic holders and print it.
- wind 4 different coild around the armature.
- use the copper tape on the armature to make the commutator.
- solder the ends of the wire to the copper tape.
- assemble all the parts.
- apply power to the commutator with copper wires


+ Result
- a 4 coil DC motor

#### Performance

The functionality of our single core motor (made from cork) is on a whole 1
